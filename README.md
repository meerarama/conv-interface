## Group Members
Meera Ramakrishnan, Tyler Rodgers, Ryan Jeon, Mason Secky-Koebel 

## Installing dependencies
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt   // Install required packages
```

## Running the program
The program can be run using the following command:
```
$ python3 interface.py
```
You must interact with the program via your terminal to progress.

You can ask the bot to take you to the first step, next step, take you back a step, or a specific step. The bot can also show you the ingredients list and the tools list.

Tell the bot you are done when completed.
